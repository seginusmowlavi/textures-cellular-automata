# textures-cellular-automata

Implementation of [Mordvintsev-Niklasson-Randazzo 2021] [Texture Generation with Neural Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07299)

Final project for J. Delon and Y. Gousseau's MVA course.

[Project assignment](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/MVA/Projets2022/TextureAC/)

## Code files

model.py : model architecture and initalization

train.py : loss functions and training loop

## Train your model

Use train.ipynb.

Quite slow on your own CPU; however Colab with CUDA takes ~5min/1000epochs.

## Play with your model (or ours)

Use test.ipynb.

## Implementation notes

See rapport.ipynb.
